<h1>Full-scale Administration</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
SilverKing has a variety of simplified configurations in which it can run.
This section discusses administering SilverKing without any of these
simplified methods. This exposes all configuration features to
the administrator. This is useful when running SilverKing in larger-scale
environments, or in environments where multiple SilverKing instances
are running.
</p>

<p>
SilverKing configuration is grouped into three levels of abstractions:
cloud, ring, and DHT (key-value store) levels. 
</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
This section briefly describes the primary SilverKing administrative tools
and gives common usage. For more complete options, run each command
without arguments.
</p>

<h2>SKAdmin</h2>
<p>
SKAdmin is used to start and stop a SilverKing instance as well as to perform related operations.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt -c &ltCommand,Command,...&gt
</code>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Start up a SilverKing instance.
</p>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -c StartNodes
</code>

<p>
Stop a SilverKing instance.
</p>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -c StopNodes
</code>

<p>
Start a SilverKing instance used for SKFS.
Create namespaces for this instance (only needs to be done the very first time), 
and start up the SKFS daemons.
</p>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -c StartNodes,CreateSKFSns,CheckSKFS
</code>

<p>
Stop SilverKing instance used for SKFS.
</p>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -c StopSKFS,StopNodes
</code>

<p>
Start a SilverKing instance. Allow for some daemon failures. Give the daemons 240
seconds to start up. Daemons that fail to start in 240 seconds will be added to
the instance exclusion set. Daemons that succeed after the first round, but fail 
after another 600 seconds will be considered failed.
Each daemon will wait 480 seconds for other unresponsive daemons.
(These options will change in the future.)
</p>
<code>
SKAdmin.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -c StartNodes -excludeInstanceExclusions -to 240,600 -into 480
</code>


<h2>
Exclusion File Monitor
</h2>
<p>
The Exclusion File Monitor is used to update the system exclusion set. It monitors a single flat file for changes, and updates the <b>system exclusion set</b> to match the flat file.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<code>
ExclusionFileMonitor.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt -f &ltExclusion File&gt
</code>
</p>

<h2>
Health Monitor
</h2>
<p>
The Health Monitor monitors and maintains the health of a single SilverKing instance. When the Health Monitor believes that an instance node daemon is unhealthy, that node is added to the <b>instance exclusion set</b>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<code>
HealthMonitor.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt -dri &ltFailed node restart interval seconds&gt -c &ltconviction limits&gt
</code>
<h3>Example</h3>
</p>
<code>
HealthMonitor.sh -g GC_MY_TEST -dri 300 -c totalGuiltyServers=10,guiltyServersPerHour=4
</code>
</p>

<h2>
Dependency Watcher
</h2>
<p>
Every SilverKing instance currently has a single <b>ring</b> associated with it that specifies
what servers are responsible for what data. This ring is a function of several different
inputs.
The Dependency Watcher is responsible for watching ring dependencies for changes and
computing a new ring whenever these dependencies change.
</p>
<p>
The inputs that are observed for changes are: the ring configuration, the topology, node weights, the storage policy, the system exclusion set, and the instance exclusion set.
If any of the above change, a new ring will be generated.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
To start a Dependency Watcher that continuously creates new rings as dependencies change:
</p>
<code>
RingDependencyWatcher.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt
</code>
<p>
To start a Dependency Watcher that runs before SilverKing is started and creates a 
new ring ignoring any old ring. (This should only be used if the SilverKing instance
in question is not running, and no data has previously been stored to this instance.)
</p>
<code>
RingDependencyWatcher.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt -s -x
</code>

<h2>
Ring Master
</h2>
<p>
As discussed above, each SilverKing instance has a ring that tells it what servers
are responsible for what data. Whenever the ring dependencies change, a new ring
is computed.
When this happens, SilverKing transitions from using the old ring to using the new ring.
The Ring Master is responsible for controlling this transition from old ring to new ring.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<code>
DHTRingMaster.sh -g &ltGrid Configuration&gt
</code>
</p>
