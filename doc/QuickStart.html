<h1>Quick Start</h1>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
This page describes three ways to get started with a simple SilverKing instance: standalone, embedded,  
and distributed. 
The standalone method is used to start a SilverKing instance
running on a single server. 
The embedded method is used to start SilverKing programmatically inside of Java code 
(e.g. in an IDE).
The distributed method illustrates how to start a SilverKing
instance running on a static set of servers.
</p>

<h2>Standalone</h2>

<p>
The simplest way to run SilverKing is to start a standalone server from the command prompt. 
This is done as follows: 
</p>
<pre>
skc -s __EMBEDDED_KVS__
</pre>
<p>
This starts a SilverKing client shell with a server embedded in it. This command will
generate a lot of output while SilverKing brings up ZooKeeper, and creates a SilverKing
instance. At the end of the output, you will see something of the form:
</p>
<pre>
WARNING: 2017:04:17 19:59:05 EDT GridConfigBase: /tmp
WARNING: 2017:04:17 19:59:05 EDT GridConfigName: GC_SK.027d3289-652a-4400-97a1-9dc674a16a7b
</pre>
<p>
These settings can then be used to connect to the running SilverKing instance. For example:
</p>
<pre>
skc -G /tmp -g GC_SK.027d3289-652a-4400-97a1-9dc674a16a7b
</pre>
<p>
will connect a skc to the running instance. The Grid Configuration returned
may also be used programmatically to interact with the newly created instance.
</p>

<h2>Embedded in a Client</h2>
<p>
Another simple way to run SilverKing is to run an embedded instance inside of the same
Java VM that the client resides in. This is useful for testing purposes. 
Data in an embedded instance will not persist after the VM exits.
See the <a href="./Examples.html">source code examples</a> for more details on this method.
(At present, starting up the embedded SK instance takes several seconds.)
</p>

<h2>Distributed</h2>

<p>
The simplest way to configure a distributed SK instance is using a 
static list of IP addresses. Given such a list, the StaticInstanceCreator.sh
script will populate all configuration required to run such an instance.
This method requires a ZooKeeper server to be up and running.
</p>
<p>
For example, to create a simple SK configuration we can run:
</p>
<pre>
StaticInstanceCreator.sh -G /tmp -d SK.MyTest -s 192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 -r 1 -z zkserver:9981 -g GC_SK_MY_TEST 
</pre>
<p>
(For servers 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3, and with ZooKeeper running at zkserver:9981.)
</p>
<p>
The SilverKing instance can be started by running
</p>
<pre>
SKAdmin.sh -G /tmp -g GC_SK_MY_TEST -c StartNodes
</pre>
<p>
Clients can then connect to this instance using Grid Config base /tmp, and Grid Configuration GC_SK_MY_TEST.
</p>
