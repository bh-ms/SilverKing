<h1>Running SilverKing</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This section describes several ways to run SilverKing starting 
with simple single-server setups, and progressing to large-scale setups that
require health monitoring and dynamic topology changes.

</p>

<h2>Standalone Server</h2>
<p>
The simplest way to run SilverKing is to start a standalone server from the command prompt. 
This is done as follows: 
<pre>
./skc -s __EMBEDDED_KVS__
</pre>
This starts a SilverKing client shell with a server embedded in it.
</p>

<h2>Embedded in a Client</h2>
<p>
Another simple way to run SilverKing is to run an embedded instance inside of the same
Java VM that the client resides in. This is useful for testing purposes. 
Data in an embedded instance will not persist after the VM exits.
See the <a href="./Examples.html">source code examples</a> for more details on this method.
(At present, starting up the embedded SK instance takes several seconds.)
</p>

<h2>Static IP List</h2>
<p>
The simplest way to configure a distributed SK instance is using a 
static list of IP addresses. Given such a list, the StaticInstanceCreator.sh
script will populate all configuration required to run such an instance.
</p>
<p>
For example, to create a simple SK configuration we can run:
<pre>
./StaticInstanceCreator.sh -G /tmp -d SK.MyTest -s <ip> -r 1 -z zkserver:9981 -g GC_SK_MY_TEST 
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Full-featured Configuration</h2>
<p>
A fully-featured distributed configuration enables powerful capabilities
such as the ability to tolerate server failures, change topology, replication level, 
and data distribution on the fly. 
See <a href="FullScaleAdministration.html">FullScaleAdministration.html</a>
for instructions on administering a full-scale SilverKing installation.
