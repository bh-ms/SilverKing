# can't do this, it won't append, even adding sudo to echo or before /etc/rc.local won't do the trick: https://superuser.com/questions/136646/how-to-append-to-a-file-as-sudo
# echo "" >> /etc/rc.local
# I like this one:
#   sudo bash -c "somecommand >> somefile"
# over:
#   echo "output" | sudo tee -a file
# b/c tee will output the "output" to the shell as well, and I want no output. I only want output if there is an error. Downside on this one is I have to move the variables (mnt, nvme) inside the sudo bash
# This will support at least the t2.micro and i3.large instance types, mounting the nvme drive for the i3.large type
sudo bash -c 'mnt=/mnt/silverking; nvme=/dev/nvme0n1;
